    <div class="title2">1. Introduction <p class="title3">Earthquakes are sudden shaking events caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earthâ€™s surface. They can cause severe damage to buildings and pose significant risks to safety. Being prepared helps reduce injuries and damage, making it essential for students and staff to recognize earthquake signs, take precautions, and respond effectively.</p></div>
    <div class="title4">2. Identification Points <p class="title5">How to tell you might be experiencing an earthquake: <ul><li>Ground shaking: Sudden, often violent shaking or trembling of the ground beneath your feet.</li><li>Rattling sounds: Loud rumbling, cracking, or shaking noises coming from the ground or structures.</li><li>Objects moving or falling: Items on shelves, desks, or walls may shift, fall, or break during shaking.</li><li>Loss of balance: Difficulty standing or walking due to ground motion.</li><li>Disruption of utilities: Flickering or loss of electricity, water leaks, or gas smells may occur immediately after shaking starts.</li><li>Animals behaving unusually: Pets or wildlife may act agitated or try to escape just before or during shaking (though this is less reliable).</li></ul></p><p class="title6">If you notice several of these signs simultaneously, it is likely you are experiencing an earthquake and should immediately follow safety protocols.</p></div>
